# Contact-Keeper-MERN-App
A Full-Stack MERN application that allows you to manage all your contacts. Uses secure authentication using JSON web authentication protocols. I created my own API using Express.js, Node.js and MongoDB in order to store all contact information including associations. For the front-end I used React.js (Using hooks and the context API) to build the client interface.
